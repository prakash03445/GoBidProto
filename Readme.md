# GoBidProto

This repository contains the shared **Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) definitions** for the GoBid project.

## Overview
- Defines gRPC services and messages for the auction system.
- Used by both the **Bid Server** and **Bid Client**.
- Not a standalone application â€” it only provides `.proto` files and generated Go code.
